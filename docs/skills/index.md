GI allows you to create a combination of intents and entities using skills. Each skill should be focused on a small set of similar intents.

Skills don't necessarily need to be intents or entities, they could also use the app event system to manipulate, log, or take over control of Good Intentions. 

Skills should be designed to do a single job and do that job well.
