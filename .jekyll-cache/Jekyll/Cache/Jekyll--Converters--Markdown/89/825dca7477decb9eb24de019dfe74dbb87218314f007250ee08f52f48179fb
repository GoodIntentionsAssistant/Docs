I"ò<p>Clients act as middleware between the server and the service it will connect to.</p>

<p>Clients could include interfaces to Facebook, Line, Hipchat, Slack, IRC and any other type of chat interface. These clients must be written by a developer to make GI useful. We hope to provide packaged clients with GI after the first stable release.</p>

<h2 id="cli-test-client">CLI Test Client</h2>

<p>GI provides a CLI test client found in <code class="highlighter-rouge">clients/cli.js</code>.</p>

<p>Load the server and then load the client. The client will identify with the server with the client token (stored in your config.js file) and the server will generate a session_token for all requests. You can then type in any command to test the app.</p>
